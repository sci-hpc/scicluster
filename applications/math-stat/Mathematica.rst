Request an Interactive Job with X11 forwarding
----------------------------------------------

Login to the frontend::

  ssh -Y username@172.21.99.202

To run Mathematica interactively, you need to request an interactive session on a compute node. See :doc:`/jobs/interactive`.

After requesting an interactive job for example on `compute-0-3` node, run in another terminal::

  ssh -Y compute-0-3

Usage
-----

To launch Mathematica in your above mentioned terminal, you will first need to make sure you have the correct module loaded. You can search for all available Mathematica versions::

  module avail Mathematica

Load the appropriate module file. For example, to run version 8.0.4::

  module load Mathematica/8.0.4

Once you have the appropriate module loaded in an interactive job, start Mathematica. The `&` will put the program in the background so you can continue to use your terminal session.::
