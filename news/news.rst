News and notifications
======================


News about planned/unplanned downtime, changes in hardware, and important
changes in software will be sent to all user emails and will be published on the login screen of Scicluster.
For more information on the different situations see below.


System status and activity
--------------------------

You can get a quick overview of the system load on Scicluster on the
`ganglia page <172.21.127.53/ganglia>`_
(only visible from within the Faculty).


Planned/unplanned downtime
--------------------------

In the case of a planned downtime, a reservation will be made in the
queuing system, so new jobs, that would not finish until the downtime,
won't start. If the system goes down, running jobs will be restarted,
if possible. We apologize for any inconveniences this may cause.
